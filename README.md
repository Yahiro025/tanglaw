# TANGLAW

TANGLAW (Tagalog for "light" or "illumination") is an AI-powered scholarship navigation portal designed for Filipino tertiary students. It combines a scholarship directory, readiness assessment, exam reviewer, and an AI chatbot companion into a single, guided dashboard experience.

---

## Problem

Filipino tertiary students face significant barriers when searching for and applying to scholarships. According to recent data, only 30.5% of Grade 3 learners show basic reading proficiency and just 0.47% of Grade 12 learners demonstrate grade-level readiness. Scholarship research is noisy, fragmented, and difficult to navigate. Many students lack access to verified grant sources, eligibility summaries, and application support tools in one place, leaving them overwhelmed and underserved by existing resources.

---

## Solution

TANGLAW addresses these challenges by providing a centralized, AI-powered platform that simplifies scholarship discovery and preparation. The system is a full-stack application with a Next.js frontend, Express backend, PostgreSQL database, LangChain AI integration, and Supabase hosting. Users can register, browse scholarships with advanced filtering, take readiness assessments, review exam materials, and chat with an AI companion named Owel to guide them through the application journey. The portal focuses on making scholarships easier to find, understand, and act on.
